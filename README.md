Estimating Effort for Complex Objectives
## Estimating Complex Tasks is Hard
Teams often have complex objectives that need estimated completion dates. This is particularly evident during the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  
  
Estimating tasks is easy to do when the work is well known and understood by those doing the work, but this is a difficult process when there are "unknown unknowns" that convolute the estimation process.

## Empiricism to the Rescue
Throughout a workflow, team members involved in doing work can gain clarity on the work they are doing and use the clarification details as the primary mechanism toward estimating complex Objectives:
- identifying patterns in work "categories"
- sharing amongst team members the complexities of the work at hand
- leveraging identified work categories to estimate complexities in work

## This App
Here, a tool will grow to facilitate the complex job of estimating complex objectives.
